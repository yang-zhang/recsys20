The challenge focuses on a real-world task of tweet engagement prediction in a dynamic environment. 
The goal is to predict the probability for different types of engagement (Favourite, Reply, Retweet and Quote Tweet) of a target user for a set of tweets, based on heterogeneous input data.

Twitter will release a large public dataset of ~200M public tweets, obtained by subsampling within ~2 weeks, that contains engagement features, user features, and tweet features.

A strong point of this challenge are the recent regulations on data protection and privacy, hence the challenge data set will be GDPR compliant: if a user deletes a tweet, or their data from Twitter, the dataset will be updated accordingly within 24 hours. Therefore, for every change in the dataset, the evaluation of the submissions will be re-done, and the leaderboard will be updated with the re-calculated metrics.
